# Competitive Programming Solutions

Welcome to my competitive programming repository! This is where I share my solutions for problems from various competitive programming contests, along with implementations of commonly used data structures, algorithms, and Python language features.

## Directory Structure

- **Algorithms-Data Structures:** This directory contains implementations of various algorithms and data structures.
- **python-features:** Implementation and testing of Python language features.
- **codeforces:** Solutions to competitive programming contests and problems on Codeforces.
- **leetcode:** Solutions to problems from Leetcode. 


## Competitive Programming Platforms

I actively participate in the following platforms:

- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

  
## How to Navigate

- Browse through the directories to find solutions based on topics, algorithms, or data structures.
- Each problem solution includes comments explaining the logic and any important considerations.
- Check the `Python-Features` directory for implementations and tests related to Python language features.
